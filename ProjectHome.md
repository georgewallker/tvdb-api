# Description: #

This is a simple API to access TVDb information about tv series. It is based on the [tvdblib](http://code.google.com/p/tvdblib/) project of bgmeiner.
This was developed with visual studio 2008 and the solution has two projects, the actual API, that creates a dll and a commented test project to show how to use the api. Those are available in the Source and downloads sections. In the Downloads section, it's available the most recent version of the dll, ready to be used. In the Downloads section there is also a .chm file with the API and test project documentation.


# Basic functions: #

  * Searches a serie by its name and retrieves a result list.

  * From the result list you can then get the actual serie's information. That information contains:
    * series info;
    * episodes info;
    * banners of series, seasons, episodes and actors.
